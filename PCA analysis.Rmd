There is high correlation in the variables in this dataset, the data is highly correlated, we should use PCA. And we should use correlation matrix, because the scale of different variable is very different and it make things hard to compare. So we should standard the data and use the correlation matrix to compare the differnt variables.

# in the PC1, all the variables afe pointed to the same direction, in the PC2, however, mean and incidence rate is at the same direction, mummirate and new_mean1 is at the same direction.
